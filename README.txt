memeKombat is a game created by Nitish Katta and Connor Hawley for the ECE 2036 Final Project.

The game allows two players to control different keys on the keyboard in order to defeat each other in a battle to
    the death.

For the extra credit portion of the product, we decided to make an amazing (nontrivial) game featuring different
    sprites, collision detection, and a varied scoring system.

We also decided to implement inheritance to make the code a bit cleaner and more efficient. Each figher is an object
    that extends AnimatedGameObject, with an associated constructor to load the correct image in the program.


Connor worked on the core of the game including making the screens, implementing transitions, and creating the
    scoring bars.

Nitish created the framework for two player functionality, added inheritance, and also worked on implementing
    transitions.


Connor and Nitish found each other through Piazza.
